## What is a Fragment Type?

A **Fragment Type** classifies a fragment’s purpose and formatting within a Usable workspace. It tells the system (and humans) how to treat the content – whether it’s a reference document, a step‑by‑step guide, a troubleshooting solution, or a reusable code template.

### Main Pre‑defined Types
| Type | Description | Typical Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Knowledge** | General information, documentation, definitions. | Reference articles, conceptual overviews. |
| **Recipe** | Step‑by‑step guides, tutorials, procedures. | Onboarding checklists, how‑to guides. |
| **Solution** | Specific problem‑solving instructions, troubleshooting. | Bug fixes, error‑handling guides. |
| **Template** | Reusable code snippets, project scaffolds, boilerplates. | Boilerplate projects, config files. |
| **Instruction Set** | Machine‑readable instructions for the LLM to perform actions. | Automation scripts, persona setups. |

### Why Fragment Types Matter?
- **Search relevance** – Types help the engine rank results appropriately.
- **UI rendering** – Different types may show distinct visual cues (icons, colors).
- **Permissions** – Some workspaces restrict creation of certain types.
- **Automation** – Instruction Sets are consumed by agents for automated workflows.
