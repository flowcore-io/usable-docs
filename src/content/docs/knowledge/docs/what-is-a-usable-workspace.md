## What is a Usable Workspace?

A **Usable Workspace** is a logical container within the Usable platform that groups together related knowledge fragments, fragment types, permissions, and other settings. It provides a scoped environment where teams can collaboratively capture, organise, and retrieve information.

### Core Characteristics
- **Purpose‑driven** – Serves a specific domain, project, or audience (e.g., public documentation, internal knowledge, social‑media content).
- **Contains** –
  - **Fragments**: atomic pieces of knowledge (e.g., definitions, tutorials, solutions).
  - **Fragment Types**: classifications such as Knowledge, Recipe, Solution, Template.
  - **Tags & Relations**: metadata that enables semantic search and linking between fragments.
- **Access & Visibility** – Workspaces can be **public** (readable by anyone) or **private** (restricted to invited members). Permissions control who can create, edit, or view fragments.
- **Compounding Knowledge** – As more fragments are added, the workspace’s knowledge graph grows, improving retrieval relevance over time.
- **Integration Points** – Workspaces can be referenced from other workspaces, used as sources for Usable Chat, or connected to external tools (e.g., n8n, Discord bots) for automation.

### Why Use a Workspace?
- **Organisational Clarity** – Keeps related information together, reducing noise.
- **Collaboration** – Enables multiple contributors to add, edit, and link knowledge.
- **Discoverability** – Tags and relations allow powerful semantic search across the contained fragments.
- **Reusable Documentation** – Public workspaces can serve as living docs that stay up‑to‑date automatically.

### Typical First Steps
1. **Create** a new workspace (e.g., "Usable Public Documentation").
2. **Define** necessary fragment types and tags.
3. **Seed** the workspace with initial fragments (definitions, guides, etc.).
4. **Set Permissions** – decide who can view or edit.
5. **Iterate** – continuously add and link new fragments as the knowledge grows.
