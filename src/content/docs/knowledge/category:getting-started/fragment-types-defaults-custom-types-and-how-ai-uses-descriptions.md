## Overview
Fragment types are organizational buckets that guide both humans and AI in classifying content.

### What You'll Learn
- Default fragment types and when to use them
- How to define custom types (e.g., Issues)
- How AI uses type descriptions to store and retrieve content

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of fragments

### Estimated Time
⏱️ 6 minutes

## Concepts

### Default Types
- Knowledge: general documentation and reference
- Recipe: step‑by‑step guides and tutorials
- Solution: troubleshooting and fixes
- Template: reusable code/config patterns
- Instruction Set: rules and behaviors the AI considers first

### Creating Custom Types
Example: "Issues" for bugs, feedback, questions (choose icon and color).

### How AI Uses Descriptions
AI reads the fragment type description to decide where to store content, improving classification and retrieval.

## Best Practices
- Keep descriptions clear and action‑oriented
- Avoid overlapping meanings across types
