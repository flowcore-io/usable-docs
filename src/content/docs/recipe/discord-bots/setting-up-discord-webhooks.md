Discord webhooks allow you to send automated messages to Discord channels from external applications.

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are a simple way to post messages from apps directly into Discord. They don't require a bot user or authentication.

## Creating a Webhook

1. Open your Discord server
2. Go to Server Settings â†’ Integrations
3. Click "Create Webhook" or "View Webhooks"
4. Click "New Webhook"
5. Give it a name and select a channel
6. Copy the webhook URL

## Sending a Message

Use a POST request to send messages:

```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Hello from my app!",
    "username": "My Bot"
  }'
```

## Advanced Features

### Embeds

Send rich embedded messages:

```json
{
  "embeds": [{
    "title": "Status Update",
    "description": "System is online",
    "color": 3066993,
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "CPU Usage",
        "value": "45%",
        "inline": true
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Rate Limits

- Webhooks have a rate limit of 30 requests per minute
- Include a delay between requests to avoid hitting limits

## Security Tips

- Never commit webhook URLs to public repositories
- Use environment variables to store webhook URLs
- Regenerate webhooks if they're accidentally exposed
- Consider using webhook tokens for additional security

## Common Use Cases

- CI/CD notifications
- Error alerts from applications
- Status updates from monitoring systems
- Automated reports and summaries
