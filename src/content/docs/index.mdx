## What is Usable?

**Usable** is an AI-enhanced team knowledge platform that transforms how development teams preserve and share knowledge. It provides a seamless bridge between AI-assisted development and team knowledge management, where solved problems and learned insights automatically become shared team assets.

Think of it as your team's collective memory—powered by AI, organized by purpose, and accessible wherever you code.

  <Card title="Persistent Memory" icon="pencil">
    All conversations and insights automatically stored in your knowledge base. Your AI assistant never forgets what worked before.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Semantic Search" icon="magnifier">
    Vector-powered search that understands intent, not just keywords. Find relevant solutions in milliseconds across your entire knowledge base.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="MCP Integration" icon="rocket">
    Remote MCP service connects Claude and other AI tools directly to your team's knowledge. No context switching required.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="AI Knowledge Graph" icon="puzzle">

## Built for Modern Development

### Automatic Knowledge Capture
Your AI assistant creates memory fragments during development sessions. Git repository detection automatically tags fragments, keeping everything organized without manual work.

### Structured Fragment Types
Four purpose-built types for different needs: **Knowledge** (documentation), **Recipes** (step-by-step guides), **Solutions** (problem fixes), **Templates** (reusable code patterns).

### Remote MCP Service
Managed service connects your AI tools to your team's knowledge. Automatic workspace association, semantic search capabilities, and session management—all handled for you.

### AI-Powered Graph Intelligence
OpenAI analyzes your fragments to extract concepts, discover relationships, and create intelligent connections. Find related knowledge through concept exploration and graph traversal.

**Documentation is automatically synchronized from Usable fragments.** Content updates in real-time as fragments are created and modified.
